  VISUAL: {
    key: 'VISUAL',
    title: 'Dominant Learning Style: Visual Learner',
    summary: 'The learning style assessment indicates that the student is a Visual Learner. The student understands and retains information most effectively through diagrams, written material, charts, and visual representations. Learning strategies aligned with visual methods are recommended for improved academic performance.',
    details: [
      'A visual learner understands and remembers information best when it is seen rather than heard, presented using diagrams, charts, images, or videos, and written clearly in notes or visual formats.',
      'Key strengths: strong observation skills, good memory for written and visual content, ability to organize information visually, clear understanding of structured concepts, better concentration while reading or watching content.',
      'Possible challenges: may struggle when information is explained only verbally or when teaching lacks diagrams or written structure.'
    ],
    recommendations: [
      'Use diagrams, charts, and mind maps',
      'Highlight important points while studying',
      'Watch educational videos and visual tutorials',
      'Rewrite notes in a structured format',
      'Use color coding for different topics'
    ]
  },
  AUDITORY: {
    key: 'AUDITORY',
    title: 'Dominant Learning Style: Auditory Learner',
    summary: 'The learning style assessment indicates that the student is an Auditory Learner. The student understands and retains information most effectively through listening, discussion, and verbal explanation. Learning strategies aligned with auditory methods are recommended for improved academic performance.',
    details: [
      'An auditory learner understands and remembers information best when it is explained verbally, heard through lectures, discussions, or audio, and learned through conversation and explanation.',
      'Key strengths: good listening and comprehension skills, strong verbal communication, ability to grasp concepts through explanation, better understanding during discussions, clear expression of thoughts in words.',
      'Possible challenges: may struggle when learning only from written notes without explanation or when concepts are presented only visually.'
    ],
    recommendations: [
      'Listen carefully to classroom explanations',
      'Participate actively in discussions',
      'Read notes aloud while studying',
      'Use audio recordings or lectures',
      'Explain topics to others to reinforce learning'

  },
  PRACTICAL: {
    key: 'PRACTICAL',
    title: 'Dominant Learning Style: Practical / Hands-on Learner',
    summary: 'The learning style assessment indicates that the student is a Practical / Hands-on Learner. The student understands and retains information most effectively through active involvement, practice, and real-world application. Learning strategies aligned with practical methods are recommended for improved academic performance.',
    details: [
      'A practical learner understands and remembers information best when learning involves doing, experimenting, or practicing, concepts are linked to real-life examples, and knowledge is applied rather than only read or heard.',
      'Key strengths: strong problem-solving through experience, high involvement and engagement, ability to learn from trial and error, better retention through practice, confidence in real-world situations.',
      'Possible challenges: may struggle when teaching is only theoretical or lecture-based, or when concepts are explained without examples.'
    ],
    recommendations: [
      'Learn by solving problems and doing exercises',
      'Use experiments, models, and demonstrations',
      'Practice concepts immediately after learning',
      'Use real-life examples to understand theory',
      'Participate actively in labs, projects, and activities'
